# ICS3C-Portfolio-conner
Hello i am conner stencill-hahn i enjoy playing video games and hanging out with frieds. Prior o this class i had never touched coding so it was all very new to me bit over time i did learn alot about coding from this class. My experience so far with this is there is a lot you can do with it and this means your always learning something new. This makes it an interesting course to take. At the start of the year i wasnt interested in computer science i was just randomly given the course but over the course it has become better than what i thought it would be. however i dont see my self going into a job involving this but it could become a hobby.
